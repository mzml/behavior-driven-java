# Cuke Driven Java
A collection of tools and techniques to enable collaboration, documentation, and automation with the JVM during software development. An exploration of [_Cucumber_](https://cucumber.io/), [_Spock_](http://spockframework.org/), and [_Concordion_](https://concordion.org/) to be used in patterns for software delivery.  
## Introduction
Essentially BDD, SBE, and variant processes try to capture the value of software delivered through examples.
### Collaborate
### Document
### Automate
## Recipes
  - unit code
  - integrations
  - functionality
  - APIs
