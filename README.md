# Cuke Driven Java
A collection of tools and techniques to enable collaboration, documentation, and automation during software development. An exploration of [_Cucumber_](https://cucumber.io/), [_Spock_](http://spockframework.org/), and [_Concordion_](https://concordion.org/) to be used in patterns for software delivery.
